Congratulations on your purchase of 42 Ground Textures!


All of the textures included in the package are realistic, high resolution and hand-taken
photographs that have been modified for in game use; specifically work best on 3D
terrain geometry.

All textures are linked to materials that have been previously made for you with matching names in all package folders. You may apply the material to any 3D geometry (ex: 3D terrain) where appropriate.

This package contains normal maps created from the original diffuse maps that look stunning in most environments!

Every texture is 1024 x 1024 pixels.


This package has everything from indoor carpets and floors to cave textures and much more!
